Giftovus Testing
=========

First off, I'd like to thank you for helping us test our application. We're very excited about the latest updates to the application. However, we know that there are bugs and things we can do better. That's what we'd like you to help with!

Our application has been designed to allow people to colaborate on gifts for their friends and family. This means no more emailing and calling folks to see what gifts they are giving.

The app has three main concepts, Groups, Ideas and Options.

  - **Groups** - A group is the community of people creating gift ideas for a single person.
  - **Ideas** - An idea is a high level for a possible gift. Think big categories like Shoes, Video Games and Cars.
  - **Options** - An option is a specific product that you may want to give. Think actual things like Red size 11.5 Nike Air Jordans, Madden 2014 and DeLorean DMC-12.

How to test
-----------

This is what we'd like you to do while testing:

1. Sign up at http://www.giftovus.com/
1. During your first run through of the site record your thoughts. What was difficult for you to do? What did you think was done well?
1. Create an issue in GitHub [here](https://github.com/tim-schilling/giftovus-testing/issues/new) and title it, "General Thoughts - Tim", except using your name rather than Tim. Don't use your last name.
1. Create/join a few groups, ideas and products. If you find anything annoying, put it in your General Thoughts issue. You can do this by clicking on your issue and adding a comment.
1. If you find a bug, please create an issue for it. When creating a issue for a bug please be sure to include the following:
  *  The operating system you're using (Mac OS X, Windows 7, Ubuntu 12.04).
  *  The browser you're using (Chrome, FireFox, Internet Explorer 9, Safari).
  *  What you were attempting to do
  *  What you actually happened
  *  A screenshot if you have the time

Have an idea that you think we should implement?
-----------
Create an issue for it and prefix it with "Idea - ", but leave off the quotes.

Again thank you for helping us with testing!
